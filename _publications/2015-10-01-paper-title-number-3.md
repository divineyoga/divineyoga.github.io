title: "Modified-MaMeMi Filter for Extraction of Frequency-Dependent Artifacts from Electroencephalograms"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2015-10-01-paper-title-number-3
excerpt: 'This paper serves as the documentation for the Modified-MaMeMi (MoMaMeMi) filter. This is a digital filter which is a modification of the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1746809415001032">MaMeMi filter</a>. This modification is an improvement over the <a href="https://raks0009.github.io/publication/2010-10-01-paper-title-number-2">AMaMeMi filter</a> where the filter is normalized with regard to sampling frequency. We use the filter to extract brainwaves from EEG in a computationally simple manner compared to traditional methods.'

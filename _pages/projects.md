Right now, I'm working on the following projects:
<br/>
1) Translation Validation of Scheduled Conditional Behavior using Petri Net based Program Models
<br/>
2) Machine Learning Methods for Sleep-Stage Classification using MoMaMeMi filtered brainwaves.
<br/>
3) Formal documentation for SamaTulyataII, a Petri net based equivalence checking tool.
<br/>
Hit me up if you would like to know more or get involved! Collaborators, guidance and ideas are always welcome.

Rakshit Mittal is an undergrad studying Electronics and Instrumentation at BITS Pilani, KK Birla Goa Campus. He took up a second major in Mathematics, just for the heck of it. He believes that learning is everywhere and it is up to the self to extract as much knowledge as possible without any prejudice. With this *mantra* he found himself designing and testing satellite antennas in anechoic chambers, to editing music videos for some of the best rappers in the country. Rakshit values self-expression and considers himself an artist at heart; research for him is nothing but an expression of his curiosity and understanding of the way the universe works.

Rakshit has authored a few papers in top-class journals and also presented his work in international conferences. He won gold at the Progamming Languages Design & Implementation (PLDI) 2020 Student Research Competition for his paper on equivalence checking. 

When he is not working on his next scientific contribution in one of the laboratories on campus, you will find him at the nearest Goan lagoon, book in hand, in pursuit of *nirvana*.

*Namaste!* I am a certified yoga practioner with a passion for fitness. My yoga journey started more than 20 years back when I was struggling with severe neck pain from spondylitis. I started practicing yoga after a life-saving suggestion from a friend. From then on, I can literally count the number of days on my fingers, when I didn't practice yoga.

Four years back I decided I wanted to help my community ailing from various diseases, which can be cured by simple yogic practices. I attended and obtained the Yoga Teachers' Training Course Certification from <a href="https://yogavidyaniketan.org/">Yoga Vidya Niketan</a> within a year. I also obtained the required certification to teach Power Yoga from the <a href="https://svyasa.edu.in/">Swami Vivekananda Yoga Anusandhana Samsthana (S-VYASA)</a>. 

Then, I started conducting my own yoga classes under the banner of 'DIVINE YOGA'. I have been conducting yoga classes for three years now and it has been a very fulfiling experience so far. I have taken both group and personal yoga sessions for Indian and American nationals. Teaching yoga has also empowered me, for I have felt my value in society increase from being just a traditional homemaker to a respected contributor to the larger community as a teacher. Many ailments can be kept at bay by including yoga in our lifestyles.

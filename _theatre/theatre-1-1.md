*Sooraj, a Dalit, works under the tutelage of Ramlal, a convert-Christian. As Sooraj undertakes a journey in search of redemption from the sins of his estranged father, he meets Sujatha, a Devadasi, whose daughter, has been kidnapped to be dedicated to the Goddess Yellamma; and Vilas, a proud, charismatic optimist, blinded by his faith in the Dalit movement.* 

*Together they take a journey that leads them through love and loss, retribution and acceptance, and most of all, a quest for identity.* 

I wrote and directed this full-length play as a member of The Drama Club, BITS Goa.

The play won 'Best Script' at Unmaad '19, IIM Bangalore, a national inter-collegiate theatre festival. 

You can watch the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKmcPpf3GNQ">video</a> of the play, though it can never capture the true essence of a live performance.
